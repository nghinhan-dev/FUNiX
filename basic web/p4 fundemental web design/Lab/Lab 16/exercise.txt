Build a Technical Documentation Page
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks

User Stories:
You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"

The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation

Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section

The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar

Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")

When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)

On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user

Your technical documentation should use at least one media query

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
